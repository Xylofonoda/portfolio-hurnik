I am currently part of a cross-functional team of five frontend and five backend developers working on three distinct SaaS products, all under a unified initiative called RSV — a comprehensive platform designed to manage and automate business processes within the construction industry.

As a frontend developer, my responsibilities have spanned multiple areas: I have collaborated closely with fellow developers and our UX/UI designer to design and implement user-centric solutions. I actively participated in key strategic meetings with our CEO and CTO, contributing insights on product development and technical feasibility.
I have been actively involved in the development and maintenance of the frontend architecture across our SaaS products — contributing to the implementation of user interfaces, new features, bug fixes, and ensuring high standards of code quality and performance. Additionally, I have supported the creation and upkeep of internal tools and shared libraries that streamline our team’s efficiency and development workflow.

Throughout this experience, I’ve strengthened my technical proficiency in React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Redux, Jest, Webpack, Vite, and React Query. I have also gained valuable expertise in performance optimization, scalable design systems, and collaborative development practices.

Moreover, I played an active role in defining our testing workflow and documentation standards. This included drafting bug reporting templates, establishing testing guidelines, and mentoring junior QA testers on prioritization and classification of defects to ensure clear and actionable feedback.

   Although my tenure in this position has been relatively short, it has provided me with meaningful exposure to e-commerce development. My primary focus has been on improving the user experience and functionality of an online store built on the Shopify platform. I have worked extensively with Liquid, Shopify’s templating language, to customize themes and develop new features tailored to business needs. In addition, I have collaborated closely with the design team to ensure the website remains visually engaging and intuitive for end users.

I have been working as a Frontend Developer at Webdevel s.r.o. for over two years, contributing to a range of projects with a primary focus on Vue.js. My responsibilities have included developing and maintaining web applications, collaborating with designers and backend developers, and ensuring our products meet high standards of quality and performance.

Beyond frontend development, I have gained practical experience in managing live websites — including tasks related to web hosting, WordPress administration, and e-commerce solutions. This exposure has provided me with a well-rounded understanding of the full web development lifecycle, from design through deployment.

I have also taken an active role in mentoring junior developers, supporting their technical growth and helping them contribute effectively to team goals. I take pride in fostering a collaborative, knowledge-sharing environment that drives continuous improvement.

My role has also included helpdesk support, where I assisted clients with technical issues and provided solutions aimed at improving their experience with our products.

Additionally, I have participated in the hiring process, contributing to candidate evaluations in terms of both technical competency and team fit. This involvement has strengthened my understanding of effective team-building and the traits that contribute to successful development teams.

Client engagement has been another key aspect of my position. I’ve been responsible for gathering requirements, facilitating communication, and aligning our solutions with client expectations — helping me develop strong interpersonal skills and a customer-focused mindset.
